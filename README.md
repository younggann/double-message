# Double-Message: Send & recieve messages through your computer!

#### About
Double-Message is an application that I made to explore the Twilio API over the summer. Currently, it uses Facebook OAuth to login users and uses the Twilio API to send and recieve custom messages. There is also an additional "Schedule Later" option to send messages at a desired future time. Lost some files over the summer as I switched computers, but am working on adding more to the app and am open to any input you may have!
